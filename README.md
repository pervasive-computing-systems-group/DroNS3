# DroNS3: Simplifying Networked Drone Applications
DroNS3 is a software framework that features an easy-to-use autopilot designed to simplify the simulation-to-hardware life cycle of drone research. DroNS3 is tailored toward drone networking and data collection applications but can also be used for more general applications.

DroNS3 utilizes the [Ardupilot SITL](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/sitl-simulator-software-in-the-loop.html) drone simulator and the [NS-3 networking simulator](https://www.nsnam.org/) together. The DroNS3 autopilot is built on top of the [DroneKit](https://github.com/dronekit) autopilot using [MAVLink](https://mavlink.io/en/). For more information on the framework's design, please refer to the [DroNS3 publication](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3597060.3597239).

# Using the framework
To set up and run DroNS3, please follow the instructions given in the [Wiki](https://github.com/pervasive-computing-systems-group/DroNS3/wiki).
